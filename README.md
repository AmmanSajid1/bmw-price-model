This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing multiple ML algorithms such as linear regression, random forest and XGboost. The notebook also showcases a hyperparameter tuning study for the random forest model using RandomSearchCV and GridSearchCV. The model performances are evaluated using appropriate model selection metrics.
